  - [ ] Try out LiveView (high speed websocket connection for 2-way communication of events) 
  - [ ] LiveViews function with phoenix templating which can react to events and do conditional rendering maaaybe try to slap React components that are conditionaly rendered from phoenix templating and react to state in our backend ?????
